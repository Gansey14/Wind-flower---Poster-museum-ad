- **Duration:** 1 week

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to transform the static Den Gamle By Poster Museum poster into an engaging and interactive digital advertisement displayed in the city. The team aimed to create a dynamic wind flower animation on the website using real-time wind speed data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Problem Statement

Den Gamle By Poster Museum sought to promote its exhibits in an innovative way by converting their static poster into an interactive digital ad for the city. The challenge was to breathe life into the poster by designing an interactive wind flower that responded to real-time wind data, providing a unique and attention-grabbing experience for passersby.

## Process

### Research and Planning

- **Understanding Den Gamle By:** The team conducted thorough research to comprehend the museum's history, identity, and exhibits. This knowledge was essential for aligning the design with their brand.
- **API Exploration:** To implement the wind flower animation, the team explored the capabilities of the OpenWeatherMap API, focusing on how to access real-time wind speed data.

### Design Phase

- **Figma Design:** Samuel Hloušek, as the UI/UX designer, took the lead in recreating the wind flower design in Figma. This phase involved:
  - Crafting a visually appealing wind flower that harmonized with Den Gamle By's branding.
  - Ensuring the flower design was aesthetically pleasing and conducive to animation.
  - Collaborating closely with team members for feedback and iteration.

### Development

- **Creating the Interactive Prototype:** Samuel Hloušek, as the frontend developer, transformed the Figma design into a functional interactive prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This phase comprised:
  - Structuring the HTML to accommodate the wind flower and additional webpage elements.
  - Applying CSS styles, animations, and responsiveness to ensure an engaging and adaptable design.
  - Integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time wind speed data.
  - Developing JavaScript logic to adjust the wind flower's rotation speed in real-time based on API data.

### Testing and Feedback

- **Rigorous Testing:** The team subjected the interactive wind flower to extensive testing across various browsers and devices to guarantee smooth performance.
- **User Feedback:** Gathering feedback from potential users helped refine the user experience and identify any usability issues.

### Final Deployment

- **Public Display:** The completed interactive wind flower website was deployed at a strategic city location near Den Gamle By. It was showcased on a large outdoor screen for maximum visibility.

## Results and Impact

- **Attention-Grabbing Advertisement:** The interactive wind flower successfully captured the attention of passersby, contributing to an increase in foot traffic around the museum's area.
- **Dynamic User Experience:** The integration of real-time wind data added a dynamic element to the advertisement, as the wind flower's rotation speed corresponded to current weather conditions.
- **Promotion of Den Gamle By Poster Museum:** The project effectively promoted Den Gamle By Poster Museum by engaging the local community with its exhibits.

## Conclusion

The Den Gamle By Poster Museum Wind Flower Interactive Ad project was a collaborative effort that transformed a static poster into a captivating and interactive digital advertisement. Samuel Hloušek's role as the UI/UX designer and frontend developer was instrumental in bringing the wind flower concept to life. This project underscored the power of creativity, design thinking, and technical proficiency in creating impactful digital experiences.
